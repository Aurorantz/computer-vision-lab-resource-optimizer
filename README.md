# Vision Lab Resource Optimization System

## Project Overview

This project aims to build an automated system that optimizes the utilization and allocation of computational resources (especially GPUs) in the Computer Vision and Image Processing Laboratory. The system uses advanced methods such as reinforcement learning to predict and allocate resources efficiently, prioritizing critical tasks like PhD thesis training or urgent student projects, thereby reducing wait times and improving overall productivity.

## Features

- Dynamic GPU resource allocation based on task priority and demand  
- Reinforcement learning-based optimization for resource distribution  
- Real-time monitoring of resource usage  
- Flexible scheduling to minimize wait times and resource wastage

## Technologies

- Python 3.x  
- FastAPI (backend API)  
- Reinforcement Learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Stable Baselines3)  
- Docker (optional for deployment)  
- Frontend framework (React/Next.js) *(if applicable)*
